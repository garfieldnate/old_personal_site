carried it around for my mission plus all of college and then several years before it was stolen
comes with hole to put a charm on; makes its usage a bit noisier, but a fun customization
startup is instant
screen is reflective, can turn on light but wastes battery
two AAA batteries and it will last months (declared 130 hours display of an entry, average 60 usage hours)
contains MILLIONS of words
great cross-dictionary searching functionality
add on with sd card or internal memory; Kanji Learner's dictionary is a really epic dictionary.
shortcut buttons for jukugo, super jump
view, then type and that starts another search. There is no other true way to do this!
seems obvious, but it remembers where you were when last opened.
tangocho saving, but only max number.
add text files
mp3 playing over jack or speaker!
auto on when opening case
full qerty keyboard
customizable function buttons
search for kanji by writing
high DPI screen for reading Chinese characters
usb for uploading CD-based dictionaries. Only works on Japanese windows, and pairs with your dictionary so you can't upload to multiple.
    Mine filled with copper rust while in Japan, and a guy in Provo fixed it for 60 bucks.

* Features I want the next jisho to have
    - mixed kanji/kana search for kanji compounds
    - copy/jump from input line (in case it's not found in current dictionary, look it up in another without having to retype/write)
    - proper jump with pronunciation-annotated words: 漢〔かん〕字
    - go back to non-color screen; just be fast!
    - upload tango-cho to computer

I received my mission call to Hiroshima, Japan when I was 18. I had already studied Japanese for a couple of years in college, and I was pretty excited to be completely immersed. I had recently changed my major to linguistics, and I was fairly obsessed with learning more. 

The final purchase I made before leaving for the MTC was a Casio electronic dictionary, purchased from White Rabbit Press. I worked cleaning houses to save up close to $500 to purchase the top-of-the-line professional level XD-GW9600. It was probably the most expensive thing I had ever paid for by myself at the time. And it was worth every penny. I used it for many hours every day as a missionary learning Japanese. I used it constantly as a student not only for studying Japanese but also for looking up words in English that I didn't know. I took it with me *everywhere*, to friend's houses and classes and church and on read walks. I had some fun conversations with curious people fascinated by my personal computer with a chicken-scratch (as far as they were concerned!) interface.

<!-- Lately I've sadly reached the device's limits and don't use it as often anymore. I would love nothing more than to breath new life into it and carry it from country to country studying new languages. -->

Let me tell you about my favorite device:
