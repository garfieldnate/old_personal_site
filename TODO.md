# TODO

* Update about page. Seriously old.
* Fix up resume. Why is it a resume? It's not aimed at anyone in particular. Should be a CV. Get rid of the `##` in the Japanese generator.
* Stupid-looking table borders inside of white area. Table should be `display:table; width:100%`, tbody should be `width:100%`, and the second cell should also be `width:100%`. Unfortunately the table display type and width are specified as styles on the table element! Oof!
* Consider switching to hugo-academic
* Link to blog repo
* The GoSen post really needs an update
