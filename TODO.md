# TODO

* linklogs?
* Use a less bright style for inline code
* CV and about pages
* styling for combo links and inline code should make their clickability obvious 
* Stupid-looking table borders inside of white area. Table should be `display:table; width:100%`, tbody should be `width:100%`, and the second cell should also be `width:100%`. Unfortunately the table display type and width are specified as styles on the table element! Oof!
* are the preambles being read correctly?
* C++ code blocks have an extra line number (https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma/issues/209)
* Consider switching to hugo-academic
* Link to blog repo
* The GoSen post really needs an update
